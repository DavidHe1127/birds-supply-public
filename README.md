# Birds Supply

This app connects birds supplier, customers and bird shop together. It is focused on frontend with technology including `react`, `relay-modern` and `graphql`. The backend will be connected with `graphql-playpen` (will rename later on).

Please note, this app is developing continously.

### TODOs
* Design the wireframe
* Use semantic UI to implement wireframe
* Follow node/edge hierachy recommended by relay
